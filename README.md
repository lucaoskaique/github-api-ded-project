## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I honed my skills by consuming APIs, importing and exporting modules, creating validations and ordering functions.
I improved my ability to organize tasks with multiple refactorings in my code. The division of responsibilities was one of the most valuable things I improved when building this project.

```html
<h1>...</h1>
```

```css
.loremClass {
  propiety: "value";
}
```

```js
const loremFunction = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
